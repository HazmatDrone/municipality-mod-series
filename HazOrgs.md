Adds the ability to create legal entities such as businesses and governments.
- Organisations can create clearance levels - these are roles that allow access to things such as [[HazSecurity]] access control
- Orgs are given a faux player title (both overall and per clearance level) that allows them to function as a player for use with other mods 
- Orgs can either be run by a leader, or have a voting system in place (companies will usually want a leader, whereas a government may choose a monarch or a democratic leader)
- Organisations can have sovreign control over a given [[HazCurrency]] to ensure it can't be forged, and control the flow and taxation of it
## Taxation
Taxes can be applied to [[HazShops]] that must be filed by the shop owner. E.g. a flat 2% tax could be set on all purchases, a $10 tax could be placed on all diamond sales, there could be multiple tax brackets for different levels of earning, etc.
