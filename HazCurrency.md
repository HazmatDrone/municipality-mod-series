Simple but comprehensive system for adding currencies for the purpose of trade. Designed for use with [[HazShops]], but can be used independently as a secure way of giving people more novel things such as tokens, IOUs, casino chips, whatever fungible exchange thing you might desire to make
- Players place a press block which allows them to mint currencies
- Players create a die for each currency they want to create. When creating the die, they can set a few important parameters:
	- The material the coin is to be made of (cannot be changed later)
	- The size of the coin (cannot be changed later)
	- The insignia on the coin (can be changed later for limited edition releases or change of figurehead)
	- The family of the currency (controlled **only** by the player or authorised [[HazOrgs]] entity creating the coin)
	- The value of the currency relative to a single unit (E.g. a dollar should have a value of 1, a penny should have a value of 0.01)
